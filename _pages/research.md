__Research themes__

- Mixed metrics(Bibliometrics)
- Technology landscaping
- Emerging technology discovery
- Technology opportunity discovery
- Health technology acceptance

__Research directions__

Innovation Lab focuses on three major research directions. First, apply machine learning techniques to the bibliometrics analysis framework to add prediction capability for identifying the upcoming innovation research topics. Secondly, precisely quantify the effect of big data in the business and management field by applying machine learning-based clustering techniques and analyzing the correlation among social and cultural factors. For example, even though Taiwan’s ICT(information and communication technology) level is ranked high (14th in the UN’s ICT index), the mobile payment adoption rate is far lower than in other countries. It indicates to some extent cultural characteristics affect the technology adoption rate. Thirdly, identify influential factors on health technology acceptance in cross-cultural environments and find associations between the adoption rate and the economic and social environment of each culture. With the vision I laid out above, I am confident that I can explore novel research topics that can encompass evaluating technological innovation, strategizing effective management of technology, and planning the trajectory of adaptable applications.
