Conducting research is a complicated process that requires various tools to enhance the efficiency and quality of the work without unnecessarily sacrificing precious time in your life. This is a list of tools and tips that I had a first-hand experience with while I was in a doctoral program.

## Principle

Whenever you have to choose a tool from a pool of options, choose one that has multiple functionalities. Such tools allow us to learn once while being able to use them for a variety of tasks.

## AMAS framework

Research is centered around pursuing knowledge, encompassing a range of activities, from gathering information to creating original contributions. These tasks must be carried out promptly, as each stage of the research process operates within specific time constraints. Maximizing efficiency calls for leveraging technology to a significant extent. The AMAS(Acquiring, Managing, Authoring, and Sharing) is a straightforward framework designed to streamline your research workflow and enhance productivity.

### Acquiring knowledge

Data sources

- Bibliographic database

  - [Web of science](https://www.webofscience.com/): It is a primary source of data for conducting bibliometric analysis from [Clarivate](https://clarivate.com/). _It requires a subscription to access it_.
  - [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic): Research article database from [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/). _It requires a subscription to access it_.

- Bibliographic software

  - [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/): Basic network analyais and visualization
  - [Gephi](https://gephi.org/): Advanced network analyais and visualization
  - [Bibliometrix](https://www.bibliometrix.org): R package

- Machine learning

  - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): General dataset search engine with various useful metadata of dataset.
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Various dataset for validating the performance of machine learning algorithms.
  - [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/): Economic dataset 
  - [Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/): Cancer drugs,cell lines, and drug response data. Useful for medical machine learning research.

### Managing knowledge

Reference management

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): This is an essential tool to manage references while preparing research manuscripts. However, it is rather a helpful tool to create knowledge by effectively organizing knowledge. I managed to handle more than 2,000 references easily when preparing manuscripts and my doctoral dissertation. It can manage various types of data such as papers, websites, and URLs to YouTube videos. Thus, we can organize all related information in a single place. It is like a virtual folder keeping various data items together. If you are familiar with EndNote, then it is a piece of cake to learn how to use Zotero. For tutorials, search `zotero site:.edu` in Google.

### Authoring knowledge

Writing R/Python codes

- [MS Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It allows us to author documents, Python source codes, and R source codes in a single editing enrvionment. Of course, this website was authored with [MS Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Authoring high quality vector graphics

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/): This tool can manipulate vector graphic using simple user interface to generate high quality graphic arts for academic manuscript. Almost all academic journals require an author to submit figures in [vector graphic format](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/0040-1625/guide-for-authors) to maintain the quality of pictures in the paper.

### Sharing knowledge

Research articles

- Conference: Submit your preliminary result to conference to get peer review from other researchers.

Reusable R/Python codes

- [Github](https://github.com/): It is not only for source code, but also for sharing text information using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature. This website is also created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). In other words, it is a free website platform.

## Dissemination

-	**Message must be delivered!** The oral presentation is the key skills to deliver your idea to the people who need it. Here is a great example of how to touch people's heart without touching it physically.
